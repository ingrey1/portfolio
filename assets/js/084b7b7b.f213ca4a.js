The physicists dreamt it up, the mathematicians validated the empirical models, and it was now up to the engineers to carry the torch forward. An artifact of such daunting complexity had never before been concretely conceived of, let alone built. The engineers were skeptical, most did not think the project could succeed. But if the alternative was a goo vat, all they could do was shrug, roll up their sleeves, and let the dice roll."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"One of the critical parts of the Godzilla Beam was the targeting system.
